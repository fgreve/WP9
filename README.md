# Innovation-exports behavior at firm-level in developing countries: How this causal relationship changes in acquisition of knowledge or R&D?
Fernando Greve 

*Abstract*
With micro-level data from a developing country (Chile), I use an econometric causality test (Granger) to study the relationship between the innovation effort and the exports propensity, distinguishing between knowledge acquisition and R&D expenditures. The results show a difference in the causal direction between innovation and exports according to the type of innovation engaged, where the acquisition of knowledge shows a mutual reinforcement (reciprocal causality); rather than R&D expenditure, where causality is found from exports towards innovation (Learning-by-Exporting) and not in the opposite direction. Both, the former idea and the results, are important given that the main source of technological progress in developing countries is related to technological adoption from developed countries, rather that in-house R&D as in developed countries firms. My results show the relevance of the export information mechanism of foreign knowledge, given that it encourages both knowledge acquisition and R&D. This finding shows that the local markets in developing countries—including a medium size and open-to-international-market such as Chile—are still farm reaching from the technological frontier.
